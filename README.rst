``doc2dash`` is an MIT-licensed extensible `Documentation Set`_ generator intended to be used with the `Dash.app`_ API browser for macOS or one of its many *free* `clones <https://doc2dash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#viewer>`_ for all relevant platforms.

If you’ve never heard of Dash.app and its likes, you’re missing out:
together with ``doc2dash`` it’s all your API documentation at your fingertips – even when you're offline!

``doc2dash``\ ’s documentation lives at `Read the Docs`_, the code on GitHub_.
It’s tested on Python 3.7 (the fully functional 2.x release line `on PyPI`_ also supports Python 2.7, 3.4–3.6, and PyPy).
Both Linux and macOS are tested although certain features are only available on macOS.
