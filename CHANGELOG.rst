----

----


2.0.1 (2014-09-16)
------------------

- Better Unicode support.
  The move from ``unicode_literals`` to explicit prefixes broke some things that are fixed now.
  `#29 <https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/29>`_, `#30 <https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/30>`_


----


2.0.0 (2014-08-14)
------------------

- Added a new parser for Sphinx documentation that uses `intersphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/ext/intersphinx.html>`_ files that are machine readable.
  That should lead to more reliable parsing and a better deduction of symbol types.
  `#28 <https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/28>`_
- Added Sphinx-based documentation.
- Added colors, styles, and a progress bar to make output more comprehensible.
- ``setup.py test`` works now.
- Internally quite a few changes happened.
  Most prominently tuples and namedtuples have been replaced by real classes and parsers don't inherit from anything anymore.
  The fundamental working principal stayed the same though so porting your parsers is trivial.


----


1.2.1 (2014-07-24)
------------------

- Fix docset name deduction if the source path ends with a ``/``.
  `#26 <https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/26>`_
